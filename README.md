### Telco Data

Our project utilizes a simulated dataset created by the [IBM Samples Team](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113). It assumes a home phone and internet services in California called Telco, offering 4 datasets: Customer demographics, account information, service information and churn data. Customer demographic information contains the customer's gender, age range, and dependent indicator. 
Customer account information contains how long they’ve been a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
Service information shows the type of services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV & movies. Customer Churn information indicates whether or not they left within the last month.
